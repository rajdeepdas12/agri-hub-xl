- **Disease Detection**: Detects diseases with confidence scoring
- **Severity Assessment**: Low/Medium/High/Critical severity levels
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Specific treatment plans and dosages
- **Yield Loss Estimation**: Percentage-based yield impact assessment

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Reporting
- **Detailed Reports**: Includes crop name, disease, symptoms, causes, treatments
- **Financial Impact**: Cost estimates for treatment and yield loss projections
- **Multiple Formats**: Text and JSON report downloads
- **Professional Formatting**: Structured, easy-to-read reports

### ðŸ”§ API Integration
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash API**: Powered by Google's latest AI model
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Complete API for upload, analysis, and reporting

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Option 1: Use the setup script (recommended)**
```bash
./setup-env.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual setup**
Copy the example environment file and configure your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The API key is already configured in the example file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBQIExHb__eENyQjeuLvxhFS7994yaMWAY
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBQIExHb__eENyQjeuLvxhFS7994yaMWAY
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test the System

Visit the test pages to verify functionality:
- `/test-upload` - Basic file upload testing
- `/test-gemini` - Comprehensive Gemini 2.0 Flash API testing

## API Endpoints
